Brief Description of Goal of Code:
To create a web-based diagnostic to evaluate the percent chance that a plant is the incredibly toxic hemlock or the edible wild carrot plant. In addition, the app works to inform users of the symptoms and ways to handle Hemlock overall.
 
Known Issues:
The footer will only appear on the last "Results" page and not at all on the mobile app.

		<p> Symptoms of Hemlock poisoning include: Trembling, Pupil dilation, Dizziness, Increased salivation, Weak Pulse, Central nervous system paralysis, Muscle paralysis, Respiratory failure, Loss of coordination, Como, or Death. </p>
		<p> Hemlock is a very tricky plant to remove. If found, do not cut down or burn; That will only release the toxins of the plant which might then get into your eyes, nose, or mouth and cause the above side effects. The roots of a Hemlock must be fully destroyed in order for the plant to truly die, and even years after it's death, the toxins can still exist in its surroundings </p>
		<p> Glyphosate infused herbicides are effective in killing poison hemlock, and if you must remove them personally, put the plant in a sealed garbage bag, let it bake in the sun and then throw the bag in the trash. It is safest to contact local specialist in removing the toxic plant. </p>
