Brief Description of Goal of Code:
 The goal of the code is to create a functioning web-based app that gives users insight into their medical condition by using a series of questions to calculate the chance the user has a cold or if it's allergies.
 
Known Issues:
 The buttons for answer choices to each question do not change color (become darker) when selected, so the user might click them more than once out of confusion. This can mess with the final percentage score. (I put a line of text to warn users to only click button once, but there is still the possibility of error)
